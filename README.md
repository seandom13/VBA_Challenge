# VBA_WallStreet

In this project, I wrote a VBA(Visual Basic Application) script that analyzing stock market data. 

Below is a list of the tasks performed within the script:

* I created a script that will loop through one year of stock data for each run and return the total volume each stock had over that year.

* I also displayed the ticker symbol to coincide with the total stock volume.
